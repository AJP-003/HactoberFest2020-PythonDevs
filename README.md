### Problem Statements

## Easy (recommended for beginners)

1. Program to display only those characters which are present at an even index number in a given string.
2. Program to return true if in a given list of numbers the first and last number is same.
3. Program to return the total count of a user input sub-string appearing in the given string
4. Given a two list of numbers create a new list such that new list should contain only odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.

## Medium (recommended for intermidiate)

1. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself. Go to    the editor
  Sample String : 'restart'
  Expected Result : 'resta$t'
2. Write a Python program to sort a list of tuples using Lambda Expression.
3. Write a Python program to count the frequency of each word in a given string and store it into a dictionary with key=word and values=frequency of word.
4. Write a Python program calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.

## Hard (recommended for advanced)
 Note: Needs to be uploaded in .pynb format

1. A simple deep neural network archietechture for binary classification of dogs and cats images using Tensor Flow.
2. A simple Linear Regression model along with printing the intercept and coefficient with a random generated data using numpy and random libraries.
3. A Multiple Linear Regression model along with printing the intercept and coefficient with a random generated data using numpy and random libraries.
4. Plot a histogram for a randomply generated dataset using numpy.
5. Create World Map representation using Folium library.
